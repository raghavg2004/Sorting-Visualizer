# Sorting Visualizer

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms, complete with detailed algorithm explanations and a network flow sorting visualizer.

## ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://dsa-sortingvisualizer.vercel.app)

## Implemented Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Features:
1. **Colored Representation of Each Step:**
    - **Blue**: Default element
    - **Yellow**: Elements being compared
    - **Red**: Element identified as in the incorrect position and to be moved
    - **Green**: Element in the correct position

2. **User Controls for Visualization:**
   - **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the sorting visualization (5 speed levels).
   - **Data Size Control**: Change the number of elements being sorted.
   - **New Data Generation**: Randomly generate a new dataset.

## Algorithm Pages:
Each sorting algorithm has its own detailed page where you can:
- **Understand the algorithm**: Step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works.
- **View its code**: Written in multiple languages like C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
- **Explore its complexity**: Time and space complexity analysis.

## How to Use:
1. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Use the control panel to adjust the speed or data size.
3. Click on "Generate New Data" to visualize a new set of data.
4. Navigate to the **Network Flow** or **Algorithm** pages to explore more about each algorithm in detail.
